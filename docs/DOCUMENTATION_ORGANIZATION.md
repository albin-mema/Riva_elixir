# Riva Ash Documentation Organization Guidelines

This document establishes clear principles and guidelines for organizing documentation in the Riva Ash project. These guidelines ensure consistency, maintainability, and ease of navigation for all users.

## 📁 Directory Structure Principles

### Primary Organization by Audience
The documentation is primarily organized by **audience type** to help users quickly find information relevant to their role:

```
docs/
├── audience/                    # Content organized by user role
│   ├── end-users/              # For system end users
│   └── developers/             # For developers (future)
├── guides/                     # Step-by-step instructions and tutorials
│   ├── getting-started/        # First-time setup and basics
│   ├── development/            # Development-specific guides
│   ├── deployment/             # Deployment and operations
│   ├── administration/         # System administration
│   └── general/                # General reference material
├── concepts/                   # Conceptual and architectural information
│   ├── architecture/           # System architecture and design
│   └── roadmap/                # Planning, strategy, and roadmaps
├── references/                 # Reference materials and specifications
│   ├── api/                    # API documentation
│   ├── components/             # UI component specifications
│   ├── configuration/          # Configuration and setup references
│   ├── testing/                # Testing guidelines and tools
│   └── development/            # Development tools and utilities
├── workflows/                  # Business processes and workflows
│   ├── business/               # Business logic and processes
│   └── ai-agents/              # AI agent operations
├── archive/                    # Deprecated and historical documentation
│   ├── deprecated/             # Old component specs
│   ├── v1/                     # Version 1 migration docs
│   └── reviews/                # Documentation reviews and audits
└── README.md                   # Main documentation entry point
```

### Secondary Organization by Content Type
Within each audience directory, content is further organized by **content type**:

- **Guides**: Step-by-step instructions and tutorials
- **Concepts**: Theoretical and conceptual information
- **References**: Technical specifications and reference materials
- **Workflows**: Process-oriented documentation

## 📝 File Naming Conventions

### Standard Naming Format
All documentation files follow this naming convention:

```
[category]-[topic]-[subtopic].[extension]
```

### Examples of Good Naming
- `getting-started-development-setup.md`
- `api-reference-authentication.md`
- `components-button-spec.md`
- `architecture-system-overview.md`
- `deployment-production-guide.md`

### Special Cases
- **Index files**: Use `README.md` for directory overview files
- **Main guides**: Use `guide.md` for primary documentation
- **Compact versions**: Use `-compact` suffix for quick reference versions
- **Legacy files**: Use `-legacy` suffix for deprecated documentation

## 🎯 Audience Targeting Guidelines

### Primary Audiences
1. **End Users** (`audience/end-users/`)
   - System users and operators
   - Focus on "how to use" the system
   - Minimal technical jargon
   - Task-oriented content

2. **Developers** (`audience/developers/`)
   - System developers and integrators
   - Focus on "how to build" and "how to integrate"
   - Technical specifications and API references
   - Code examples and implementation details

3. **Administrators** (`guides/administration/`)
   - System administrators and operators
   - Focus on "how to manage" and "how to maintain"
   - Configuration and deployment guides
   - Troubleshooting and maintenance procedures

### Content Placement Rules
- **User-facing content**: Goes in `audience/` or `guides/`
- **Technical specifications**: Goes in `references/`
- **Conceptual information**: Goes in `concepts/`
- **Process documentation**: Goes in `workflows/`
- **Historical/deprecated content**: Goes in `archive/`

## 🗂️ Content Classification System

### Content Types
1. **Guides** (`guides/`)
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Tutorials and walkthroughs
   - Best practices and procedures

2. **Concepts** (`concepts/`)
   - Architectural overviews
   - Design decisions and rationale
   - Strategic planning documents

3. **References** (`references/`)
   - API documentation
   - Component specifications
   - Configuration parameters
   - Testing guidelines

4. **Workflows** (`workflows/`)
   - Business processes
   - Operational procedures
   - Integration workflows

### Audience-Specific Content
- **For end users**: Focus on usability and task completion
- **For developers**: Focus on implementation and integration
- **For administrators**: Focus on management and maintenance
- **For all audiences**: Provide clear navigation and context

## 🔗 Cross-Referencing Guidelines

### Internal Linking
- Use relative paths for internal links
- Link to related concepts and prerequisites
- Provide context for external references
- Use descriptive link text

### Navigation Structure
- Each directory should have a `README.md` file
- Use consistent heading structures
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Provide clear "next steps" guidance

## 📊 Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Content accuracy and relevance checks
- **Quarterly**: Structure optimization and reorganization
- **Annually**: Comprehensive audit and cleanup

### Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: All necessary information is included
- **Accuracy**: Technical information is up-to-date and correct
- **Usability**: Content is easy to find and understand
- **Consistency**: Style and structure are uniform

### Update Procedures
1. **Content Updates**: Update existing files as needed
2. **New Content**: Follow established naming and organization conventions
3. **Deprecation**: Move outdated content to `archive/` with clear redirects
4. **Structure Changes**: Update navigation and cross-references when reorganizing

## 🚀 Best Practices

### For Content Creators
1. **Know your audience**: Tailor content to the intended users
2. **Use clear structure**: Headings, lists, and consistent formatting
3. **Provide context**: Explain why information matters and how to use it
4. **Include examples**: Practical examples and code snippets where appropriate
5. **Keep it current**: Regularly update content to reflect changes

### For Maintainers
1. **Monitor usage**: Track which documents are most accessed
2. **Gather feedback**: Collect user input on documentation usability
3. **Optimize structure**: Continuously improve organization and navigation
4. **Archive appropriately**: Move outdated content to archive with clear notices
5. **Document changes**: Keep a changelog of significant reorganizations

### For Reviewers
1. **Check completeness**: Ensure all necessary information is included
2. **Verify accuracy**: Confirm technical information is correct
3. **Assess usability**: Evaluate how easy the content is to find and understand
4. **Review consistency**: Check for uniform style and structure
5. **Test navigation**: Verify that links and cross-references work correctly
