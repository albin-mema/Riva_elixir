### Technical Workflows
- **Technical prerequisites** and requirements
- **System dependencies** and integration points
- **Automation scripts** and configuration
- **Error handling** and recovery procedures
- **Performance considerations** and optimization
- **Monitoring and alerting** setup

### AI Agent Workflows
- **AI model specifications** and capabilities
- **Training data requirements** and preparation
- **Integration points** with existing systems
- **Performance monitoring** and optimization
- **Ethical considerations** and bias mitigation
- **Continuous improvement** procedures

## Contributing

When creating new workflow documentation:

1. **Determine the workflow type** and appropriate subdirectory
2. **Map the complete process** with all steps and decision points
3. **Include visual aids** (flowcharts, diagrams) for clarity
4. **Define roles and responsibilities** clearly
5. **Add success criteria and metrics** for evaluation
6. **Include troubleshooting procedures** for common issues
7. **Update this README** and relevant index files
8. **Cross-reference** related workflows and documentation

## Maintenance

- **Process Reviews**: Regular review and optimization of workflows
- **Version Control**: Track changes to workflow procedures
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor workflow effectiveness and efficiency
- **User Feedback**: Incorporate feedback from workflow participants
- **Archive**: Move deprecated workflows to [archive](../archive/)
