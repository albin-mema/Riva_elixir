## Product Features — What the App Does Today

This page lists current features in practical, non‑technical terms, with enough detail to use the product effectively.

### For businesses (operators)

1) Business setup and structure
- Create one or more businesses you operate
- Define how your space is organized so staff and customers can find things:
  - Areas/plots (top level), sections inside areas, and individual items (bookable resources)
  - Optional visual layouts and positions for a clear floor plan
- Typical outcomes: a navigable inventory with names, descriptions, and locations for every bookable item

2) Availability management
- Decide when each item can be booked using simple schedules (days of week, start/end times)
- Add one‑off exceptions for holidays, maintenance, or special events (makes specific dates/times unavailable)
- Place temporary holds to briefly block time on an item while you coordinate (e.g., pending approval or walk‑ins)
- Result: customers and staff only see bookable times that respect schedules, exceptions, and holds

3) Reservation management
- Create reservations on behalf of clients by selecting an item and time range from available slots
- Pending vs confirmed: new bookings can be marked pending, then confirmed when the client commits
- Double‑booking prevention: the system prevents overlaps with existing reservations or active holds
- Recurring reservations: create a repeating booking pattern; individual instances can be reviewed and managed
- Edit notes and key details on a reservation (e.g., special instructions)

4) People management
- Clients: keep a simple customer list (name, optional contact details); both registered and unregistered clients are supported
- Employees: add staff accounts and assign permissions by business so people only see what they should

5) Pricing and payment tracking
- Define pricing rules/rates for items and time periods (e.g., base rates, date‑range/seasonal adjustments)
- Record payments against reservations for accurate bookkeeping
- See at‑a‑glance totals and recent payment activity in the finance area
- Note: payment processing is not integrated; this is internal tracking/record‑keeping

6) Inventory management (the bookable catalog)
- Add items (what customers reserve), item types (categorization), and their grouping into sections and areas
- Keep layouts and positions up to date so staff can see where items are located
- Maintain a clean catalog by archiving items you no longer offer

7) Communication
- Use built‑in chat rooms to coordinate work and discuss bookings with your team
- Keep conversation history available alongside your daily work

8) Administration and oversight
- Use the admin panel to browse all data in one place
- Review historical changes and safely archive records when they are no longer active
- Rely on the system’s change history to understand who changed what and when

9) Settings
- Adjust organization‑wide preferences and defaults used across the app

### For end customers (clients)

1) Check availability
- Pick what they want to book and a date; see available time slots that respect business schedules and exceptions

2) Request a booking
- Provide basic details (name, optional contact info) and choose a time range
- A booking may be created as pending until the business confirms it

3) Confirm a booking (when confirmation is required)
- Confirm a pending booking when ready
- Optionally register to make future lookups simpler

4) Review bookings
- Look up past bookings by email (when the business enables this workflow)

### Operator screens (where you’ll work)
- Dashboard — overview of activity
- Reservation center — plan and manage bookings
- Inventory — manage items, layouts, and availability
- People — manage clients and employees
- Finance — pricing and payment records
- Chat — internal messaging
- Settings — app configuration
- Admin — full data administration (for authorized users)

### How features behave (in practice)
- Availability is calculated from three things: schedules (what’s normally open), exceptions (one‑off changes), and holds (temporary blocks)
- The system blocks overlapping bookings and respects active holds to avoid double‑booking
- Bookings have a simple lifecycle: created (often pending) → confirmed; you can add notes throughout
- Recurring bookings create a series you can manage as a whole or review instance by instance
- Pricing is applied based on your active pricing rules; payment entries are recorded for tracking, not processed

### Out of scope (today)
- No integrated payment processing (card/wallet)
- No automated notifications (SMS/email) built into the product experience
- No public API details are required to use the app as an operator; all core tasks are available in the screens above
