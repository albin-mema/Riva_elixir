# Reservo â€” Universal Reservation Platform

Reservo is a flexible, domain-agnostic reservation system for any reservable resource (venues, equipment, rooms, campsites, services, etc.). It is built with Elixir/Phoenix and the Ash Framework, with a LiveView-first UI and a strong focus on reliability, auditability, and clear business workflows.

## Mission

Provide a single, extensible platform for all kinds of reservations. Unlike niche solutions (e.g., hotel-only), Reservo models common reservation concepts that apply across industries while remaining customizable per business.

## Core Principles

- Full-day reservations only (no hourly/time-slot booking)
- Constant base pricing per item type with business-specific exceptions
- Treat all days equally (no weekday/weekend pricing by default)
- Cash payment tracking (no online card processing)
- Grid-based layout for placing items (row/column), not free-form x,y
- Strong authorization with Ash policies (SimpleSat SAT solver)
- LiveView UI with Tailwind and Flop for tables/pagination
