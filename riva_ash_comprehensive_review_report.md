# Riva Ash Codebase Review Against Ash Usage Rules

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive review analyzes the Riva Ash codebase against established Ash usage rules. The review covers 11 key files across the application and identifies specific violations, patterns of non-compliance, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

**Overall Assessment**: The codebase demonstrates good understanding of Ash fundamentals with proper resource definitions, domain configuration, and separation of concerns. However, there are critical violations in web controllers that need immediate attention to maintain architectural integrity.

## Detailed Findings

### Files with Violations

#### 1. booking_controller.ex
**File**: `packages/riva_ash/lib/riva_ash_web/controllers/booking_controller.ex`

**Violations Found**:
- **Lines 137, 262**: Direct Ash calls in web modules violate the rule "Avoid direct Ash calls in web modules - Don't use `Ash.get!/2` and `Ash.load!/2` directly in LiveViews/Controllers, similar to avoiding `Repo.get/2` outside context modules"

**Specific Issues**:
```elixir
# Line 137 - Direct Ash call in controller
Item.read(domain: RivaAsh.Domain)

# Line 262 - Direct Ash call in controller  
Client.by_email(email, domain: RivaAsh.Domain, load: [:reservations])
```

**Recommendations**:
1. Create code interfaces in the domain for these operations
2. Replace direct Ash calls with domain code interface calls
3. Example fix:
   ```elixir
   # In domain.ex
   resource Item do
     define :list_items, action: :read
   end
   
   resource Client do
     define :get_client_by_email, action: :read, get_by: [:email]
   end
   
   # In controller
   # Instead of: Item.read(domain: RivaAsh.Domain)
   # Use: RivaAsh.Domain.list_items!()
   
   # Instead of: Client.by_email(email, domain: RivaAsh.Domain, load: [:reservations])
   # Use: RivaAsh.Domain.get_client_by_email!(email, load: [:reservations])
   ```

#### 2. auth_controller.ex
**File**: `packages/riva_ash/lib/riva_ash_web/controllers/auth_controller.ex`

**Violations Found**:
- **Line 166**: Direct Ash call in web module violates the rule "Avoid direct Ash calls in web modules"

**Specific Issues**:
```elixir
# Line 166 - Direct Ash call in controller
Ash.get(RivaAsh.Accounts.User, user_id, action: :seed_read, domain: RivaAsh.Accounts)
```

**Recommendations**:
1. Create a code interface in the Accounts domain for user retrieval
2. Replace the direct Ash call with a domain code interface call
3. Example fix:
   ```elixir
   # In accounts domain.ex
   resource User do
     define :get_user_by_id, action: :seed_read, get_by: [:id]
   end
   
   # In controller
   # Instead of: Ash.get(RivaAsh.Accounts.User, user_id, action: :seed_read, domain: RivaAsh.Accounts)
   # Use: RivaAsh.Accounts.get_user_by_id!(user_id)
   ```

## Conclusion

The Riva Ash codebase demonstrates solid understanding of Ash framework fundamentals with proper resource definitions, domain configuration, and separation of concerns. The critical violations are architectural in nature (direct Ash calls in controllers) but can be resolved systematically by implementing proper code interfaces.

The codebase is well-structured and follows most Ash usage rules correctly. With the recommended fixes, particularly the elimination of direct Ash calls in web modules, the codebase will achieve full compliance with Ash usage rules and maintain better architectural integrity.

**Overall Risk Level**: Medium
**Effort to Comply**: Medium
**Benefits**: High (Improved maintainability, better testability, cleaner architecture)
