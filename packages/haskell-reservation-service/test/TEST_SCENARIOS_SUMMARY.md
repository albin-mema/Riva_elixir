# Comprehensive Test Scenarios Summary

## Beach Umbrella Scenarios (12 tests)

### Basic Capacity Management
1. **Single Person, Single Umbrella** - Simplest case, person books umbrella with capacity 2
2. **Couple in One Umbrella** - 2 people in umbrella with capacity 2 (exact fit)
3. **Family Exceeds Capacity** - 4 people try to book umbrella with capacity 2 (should fail)

### Group Allocation Challenges
4. **Multiple Umbrellas Needed** - 4 people need 2 umbrellas (current system limitation)
5. **Friends Group Split** - 6 friends want 3 umbrellas in same area (adjacency preferences)

### Time-Based Scenarios
6. **Consecutive Days Family Vacation** - 7 consecutive days booking with conflicts
7. **Peak Season Conflicts** - Busy beach day with overlapping reservations
8. **Early Morning Booking** - Booking before beach opens (outside operating hours)
9. **Weather Closure** - Storm day exception blocking bookings

### Business Rules
10. **Last-Minute Booking** - Insufficient advance notice (minimum notice period)
11. **Premium Umbrella Deposit** - Special umbrellas requiring deposit
12. **Cancellation Scenarios** - Free vs strict cancellation policies

## Restaurant Scenarios (17 tests)

### Basic Table Management
1. **Couple Dinner** - Most common case, 2 people at table for 4
2. **Large Family Dinner** - 8 people at table for 8 (exact capacity match)
3. **Oversized Party** - 10 people trying to book table for 8 (should fail)
4. **Single Person Large Table** - 1 person at table for 8 (inefficient but allowed)

### Time Constraints
5. **Business Lunch** - Time-sensitive lunch with duration limits
6. **Peak Dinner Rush** - Multiple overlapping reservations during busy hours
7. **Late Night Dining** - Booking after kitchen closes
8. **Rapid Table Turnover** - Buffer time between seatings

### Advance Planning
9. **Advance Reservation** - Booking 30+ days ahead (beyond advance window)
10. **Same-Day Reservation** - Insufficient advance notice for same-day booking

### Special Events
11. **Special Event Deposit** - Large parties requiring deposits
12. **Corporate Event Multiple Tables** - 20 people needing multiple tables
13. **Holiday Closure** - Restaurant closed for holidays

### Operational Policies
14. **Cancellation Policies** - Different policies for different party sizes
15. **Seasonal Capacity** - Reduced capacity in winter (patio closed)
16. **Walk-in vs Reservation Priority** - Confirmed reservations vs provisional walk-ins
17. **Special Requirements** - Wheelchair access, quiet sections, window seats

## Cross-Domain Edge Cases (9 tests)

### System Limits
1. **Zero Capacity Maintenance** - Resource temporarily unavailable
2. **Exact Capacity Match** - Party size exactly matches resource capacity
3. **Many Existing Reservations** - Performance test with 50+ existing bookings

### Complex Rules
4. **Multiple Time Windows** - Morning and evening slots only (afternoon gap)
5. **Complex Duration Requirements** - Must be between 2-4 hours
6. **Resource Dependency Edge Cases** - Multiple resources with different capacities

### Technical Edge Cases
7. **Timezone Edge Cases** - Timezone-aware bookings
8. **Boundary Conditions** - Adjacent vs overlapping time slots
9. **Policy Overrides** - Administrative overrides for special cases

## Common Real-World Patterns Identified

### Capacity vs Party Size Relationships
- **Under-utilization**: 1 person at table for 8 (allowed but inefficient)
- **Perfect fit**: 4 people at table for 4
- **Over-capacity**: 6 people at table for 4 (rejected)

### Group Allocation Preferences
- **Couples together**: 2 people want privacy
- **Friends adjacent**: Want to socialize across multiple resources
- **Families split**: Large families need multiple adjacent resources
- **Corporate groups**: Need multiple resources with coordination

### Time-Based Patterns
- **Consecutive bookings**: Multi-day vacations, weekly meetings
- **Peak hour conflicts**: Dinner rush, beach peak hours
- **Buffer requirements**: Cleaning time, table turnover
- **Operating hour restrictions**: Kitchen hours, beach hours

### Business Rule Complexity
- **Tiered policies**: Different rules for different party sizes
- **Seasonal variations**: Capacity changes, holiday closures
- **Payment requirements**: Deposits for large groups, premium resources
- **Cancellation tiers**: Stricter policies for larger commitments

### System Limitations Identified
- **No automatic multi-resource allocation**: System can't automatically book 3 umbrellas for 6 people
- **No group preference support**: Can't specify "couples together, singles separate"
- **No resource attribute matching**: Can't request "wheelchair accessible table"
- **No adjacency preferences**: Can't request "tables next to each other"

## Future Enhancements Needed

1. **Group Booking System**: Support for sub-group allocation with preferences
2. **Resource Attributes**: Wheelchair access, location preferences, amenities
3. **Multi-Resource Transactions**: Atomic booking of multiple related resources
4. **Smart Suggestions**: Alternative allocations when preferences can't be met
5. **Dynamic Pricing**: Peak hour surcharges, group discounts
6. **Waitlist Management**: Queue system for fully booked periods

## Test Coverage Statistics
- **Total Scenarios**: 38 comprehensive test cases
- **Domain Coverage**: Beach umbrellas, restaurants, cross-domain
- **Rule Coverage**: Capacity, time, business rules, edge cases
