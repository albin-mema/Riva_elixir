## üéØ Quick Navigation

### For Developers
1. Start with [`ash_architecture_todo.md`](ash_architecture_todo.md) to understand current technical debt and improvement opportunities
2. Review [`testing_guide.md`](testing_guide.md) for testing standards and practices
3. Examine the Mermaid diagrams to understand complex workflows

### For Architects
1. Study the architecture TODOs to understand alignment with Ash Framework best practices
2. Review the workflow diagrams for system design insights
3. Consult the glossary for technical terminology

### For QA/Testers
1. Follow [`property_based_browser_testing.md`](property_based_browser_testing.md) for testing approach
2. Use [`testing_guide.md`](testing_guide.md) for comprehensive testing guidelines

## üìñ Visual Documentation

The Mermaid diagrams in this directory provide visual representations of complex workflows:

- **Basic Reactor Flow**: Shows the fundamental reactor pattern used throughout the system
- **Recurring Reservation Reactor Flow**: Illustrates the complex multi-step process for handling recurring reservations
- **Recurring Reservation Workflow**: Provides an end-to-end view of the recurring reservation creation and processing pipeline

These diagrams can be rendered in any Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid syntax.
